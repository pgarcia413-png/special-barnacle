Understanding the difference helps you hire the right support and avoid paying for services you don’t need.

### What a bookkeeper does
A bookkeeper focuses on **day-to-day financial accuracy:**
- Recording transactions
- Reconciling bank and credit card accounts
- Categorizing expenses
- Managing invoices and bills
- Producing monthly reports

Think of bookkeeping as maintaining the health record of your business.

### What a CPA does
A Certified Public Accountant (CPA) typically handles:
- Tax preparation and filing
- Tax strategy and compliance
- Financial forecasting
- Business structure advice
- Audits (if needed)

CPAs rely on clean books to do their work effectively.

### The key difference
- Bookkeepers manage the present.
- CPAs plan and report on the past and future.

One without the other creates problems. A CPA can’t give good advice if the books are messy. A bookkeeper doesn’t replace tax strategy.

### Do you need both?
Most small businesses do best with:
- A bookkeeper year-round
- A CPA at tax time or quarterly

This combination keeps costs down and accuracy high.

>Bottom line: When bookkeeping is neglected, CPAs often have to “fix” issues during tax season—at much higher hourly rates. Clean books make everything else easier, cheaper, and less stressful.

If you’d like clarity around your books or aren’t sure where to start, a bookkeeping review can help you understand exactly where things stand and what to do next.
