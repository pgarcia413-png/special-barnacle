The important thing is knowing what to do next.

### Step 1: Don’t avoid it
Avoidance is the most expensive choice. The longer books are ignored, the harder and costlier cleanup becomes.

Late books don’t mean disaster, but silence does.

### Step 2: Gather what you have
You don’t need perfection to start. Begin with:
* Bank statements
* Credit card statements
* Access to your accounting software
* Any prior reports (even incomplete ones)

A professional can work with gaps.

### Step 3: Prioritize accuracy over speed
Rushing to “just get it done” often creates more problems. Cleanup should focus on:
* Correct balances
* Proper categorization & classification
* Reconciled accounts

Clean books once are better than rushed books twice.

### Step 4: Consider a cleanup project
Bookkeeping cleanup is a structured process:
* Reviewing past periods
* Reconciling accounts
* Correcting errors
* Rebuilding reports

Once cleaned, monthly bookkeeping becomes straightforward and affordable.

### Step 5: Put systems in place
After cleanup, ongoing bookkeeping prevents this from happening again. Most business owners feel immediate relief once they can trust their numbers.

>The good news: Behind books are fixable. And once they’re fixed, many business owners wish they’d done it sooner.

If you’d like clarity around your books or aren’t sure where to start, a bookkeeping review can help you understand exactly where things stand and what to do next.
